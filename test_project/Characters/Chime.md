# Chime
**Role**: Rabbit Healer (Silent Zone Specialist)  
**Resonance Trait**: Flat (no emotional vibration)  
**Why It Matters**:  
Chime’s resonance is *mechanically stable but emotionless*—a direct consequence of a Silent Zone fracture during a childhood accident where their steam-powered healing engine overloaded. Unlike other rabbits, Chime can’t "feel" emotions (no warmth, no vibration), but their flat resonance allows them to *precisely tune* Silent Zones by redirecting residual steam energy without emotional interference. This makes them uniquely capable of healing the city’s oldest district (where bears’ historical resonance is strongest), but each healing risks *further isolating* their own connection to the world.  

**Key Conflict**:  
Chime’s healing requires physical contact with Silent Zones—yet their flat resonance means they *don’t feel* the city’s emotional "pulse" during healing. This creates a paradox:  
- *To heal*: They must press their paws against Silent Zone edges (like the bear district), converting chaotic steam into stable resonance.  
- *To survive*: They must avoid emotional feedback (e.g., a bear’s warning rumble) that would shatter their flat resonance.  
- *The cost*: Every healing leaves Chime more disconnected from the world—until they either lose their ability to heal or become *completely silent* (no resonance = no steam magic = no life).  

**Why This Fits Your Story**:  
- **No emotional trauma tropes**: Chime’s "flat" resonance isn’t a weakness—it’s a *functional adaptation* to their role. Their healing is *mechanical* (like tuning pipes), not emotional.  
- **Thematic depth**: Their struggle embodies *"what happens when you lose your voice"*—not through silence, but through *mechanical isolation*.  
- **Steampunk synergy**: Uses bioluminescent steam (from pigs’ waste processing) to power their healing, avoiding human-centric solutions.  
- **No clichés**: No "chosen one" narrative—Chime’s power comes from *precision*, not emotional strength.  

> 💡 *Example*: When Chime touches a Silent Zone in the bear district, their paws glow with soft blue steam (the city’s "calm" resonance). But they feel *nothing*—only the cold brass of the pipes. This is why they’re the only one who can heal the oldest district... and why the city’s fate depends on them staying silent.

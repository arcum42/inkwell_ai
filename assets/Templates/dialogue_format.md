# Dialogue Formatting Guidelines

## Standard Format

```
"Can you hear me?" Sarah asked, peering through the darkness.

"Barely," James replied. "It's too dark to see anything."
```

## With Action Tags

```
"I'm not sure about this plan." Maya glanced over her shoulder before 
speaking. "What if someone finds out?"

"No one will." David squeezed her hand reassuringly. "Trust me."
```

## Techniques

### Subtext (What's NOT being said)
Use pauses, interruptions, and actions to show underlying tension.

### Dialect & Voice
Give each character a unique way of speaking - word choice, rhythm, grammar.

### Pacing
Short, punchy dialogue creates urgency. Longer exchanges allow for intimacy or revelation.

### Balance
Mix dialogue with action and narration. Avoid walls of text.
